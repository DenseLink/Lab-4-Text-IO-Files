# Lab 4: Text I/O Files

Welcome to the Lab 4 repository, focusing on Text Input/Output operations and file handling in C++. This repository contains a comprehensive example demonstrating how to work with CSV files, read data, and perform data processing using C++.

## Overview

This lab session introduces the concepts of reading from and writing to text files in C++, using streams. The main application processes data from CSV files containing LEGO sets information and demonstrates various operations such as parsing, data manipulation, and output formatting.

## Features

- **Data Reading**: Demonstrates how to read data from CSV files efficiently.
- **Data Processing**: Includes examples of data filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
- **Modular Programming**: Showcases the use of header files for declarations and cpp files for definitions to organize code logically.

## Files Description

- `Lab 4.pdf`: Contains the lab instructions and guidelines.
- `main.cpp`: The main C++ source file that contains the application logic.
- `main.h`: The header file with function declarations and data structure definitions.
- `lego1.csv`, `lego2.csv`, `lego3.csv`: Sample CSV files containing data about LEGO sets.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or compiler environment.
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.
4. The application will read the sample CSV files and output processed data to the console.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming concepts
